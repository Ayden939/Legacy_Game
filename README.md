# Legacy_Game
This is a game I am coding in part for learning in part for fun. It is a dungeon crawl, where you try to descend 100 floors. Your character may die or retire, so their offspring will take up the journey! At this time I am mainly focused on the game logic by making a text based game for now, with the hope of potentially expanding it possibly using a game engine and graphics later. Enjoy :)
