# Legacy_Game
This is a game I am coding in part for learning in part for fun. It is a dungeon crawl, where you try to descend 100 floors. Your character may die or retire, so their offspring will take up the journey! At this time I am mainly focused on the game logic by making a text based game, with the hope of potentially expanding it possibly using a game engine and graphics later. I hope you enjoy it :)

Features (Current):
10 floor gameplay
Simple data log for when enemy is defeated
Varied attack amounts and heal risk factor

How To Play:
1. Download project contents, open in code editor of your choice
2. In the command prompt enter python3 main.py
3. Have fun!
